# Book library
This is my attempt at an exercise from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). I wanted to do this one all vanilla without using `innerHTML` to render the content on the page.

## Requirements
- Render a list of books, a "library".
- Add more books to the library via a form that is displayed when clicking a "New book" button.
- Each book in the list has a button that removes the book from the library.
- Each book has a button that toggles the `read` status of that book.
